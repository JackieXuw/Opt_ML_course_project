# Optimization for Machine Learning - Mini-Project

## Introduction
The mini-project focuses on the implementation of different methods for hyperparameter tuning,
and the analysis of their impact on a machine learning model.

Three hyperparameter tuning methods are considered:
+ Grid search
+ Random search
+ Bayesian optimization
